# Cosmos

### How to run it?

To initiate the Cosmos software, first open the file _runCosmosBeta.m_ and, if wanted, change any of the simulation options in the struct _parameters_. To run the program, just press the _run_ button on MATLAB.

After pressing the button _run_, the simulation will automatically start, generating log messages on the MATLAB's Command Window.

In the last step of the simulation, the program generates and prints a list of the custom object names and the respective custom classes used in the Cosmos software.

To open the documentation for the custom classes used in Cosmos, enter this command in MATLAB's Command Window:
```
opendocs
```

To generate and open an updated UML class diagram for the Cosmos software, enter this command in MATLAB's Command Window:
```
openuml
```
