Reasons for Standard Configuration
________________________________________________________________________

- Limiting code width to 80 characters:
  - Leaves space for putting two versions side by side for comparison
  - Removes the really annoying horizontal scrolling
  - Readable with a larger font on laptops with smaller screen
  - Forces the programmer to write concise code lines
  - Forces long and complex code to be implemented as a function
  - Leaves space for navigation views in IDEs
  - Prints code for documentation without arbitrarily breaking lines
  - A great deal of real estate goes to waste when you have a few lines
    that extend far to the right when most of the other lines don't

- Setting tab size to 2:
  - Allows more space for the actual code

- Setting tab to insert spaces instead of a tab character:
  - Tab characters have different sizes in different programs
  - Inserting spaces guarantees consistency when copying/pasting between
    different editors or when viewing code online
